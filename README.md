# Amp: A crowdsourcing Android app using libspotify

## Features

* Integration with [libspotify](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/) 12.1.51 (deprecated)
* Stream playback to Chromecast with [libFLAC](https://xiph.org/flac/api/)
* Low-latency playback with [OpenSL ES](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/audio/opensl-for-android.html)
* Integration with [Slack RTM API](https://api.slack.com/rtm)
* Integration with [Twitter Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview)
* Integration with [Google CSE API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview) for spelling correction
* Post to an Amp URL
* Sync playback from an Amp URL
* Create [Spotify tracksets](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/widgets/spotify-play-button/)

## Remarks

* You need to be a Spotify Premium user
* It will not work on x86 Android since there is no libspotify released for that platform

## Check spelling with Google's Custom Search Engine API

This approach for spelling correction doesn't always return results, however because Google's results are based on popular terms it works well for correcting the spelling of popular music.

Create your [Custom Search Engine](https://www.google.com/cse/) configured to [Search the entire web](https://support.google.com/customsearch/answer/2631040?hl=en) and get your [Search engine ID](https://support.google.com/customsearch/answer/2649143?hl=en). Keys for the API can be obtained from your [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
